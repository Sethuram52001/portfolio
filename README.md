# Welcome to My Portfolio!
Welcome to my portfolio project! I have built this portfolio with the idea of this project serving as template portfolio for students who're passionate about computer science or software professionals to be more specific once again in the field of web development, as I'm a student aspiring to become a full stack developer.

# Tailoring the portfolio to your needs!
All the data for each section is stored in their respective data files. For examples, if you're planning to add on your own certifications, head on to the certifications component and open up the certifications.data.js file and edit the details to suit your needs. 

Attention I have used firestore to fetch the blogs as I write blogs pretty often. So, if you feel that some data in your portfolio website needs constant updates then feel free to upload those data in firstore or any database of your choice and fetch them to your component.

The animated illustrations which you see over in the website are lottie files - you can find more cool lottie files in:

# Getting Started/Installation
Pretty much the same as the standard gatsby application (or kind of similar to react in someways as gatsby is based on react), so all the usual react-scripts are available to your disposal. So, over here I restricted myself to the instructions to only the essentials.
## 1. Clone the repository or download the zip
```
https://github.com/Sethuram52001/portfolio.git
```

## 2. Install the dependencies
```
npm install
```

## 3. Start the application
```
gatsby develop
```
Runs the app in the development mode.
Open http://localhost:8000 to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

# Deployment
For deployment, you can use any hosting service which supports ssr sites. For more details you can refer the gatsby docs:
- [Gastby Docs](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/docs/how-to/previews-deploys-hosting/)

# Techonologies Used
- Gatsby
- Graphql
- react-headroom
- reactstrap
- react-bootstrap
