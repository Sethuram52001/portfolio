# Tailoring the portfolio to your needs!
All the data for each section is stored in their respective data files. For examples, if you're planning to add on your own certifications, head on to the certifications component and open up the certifications.data.js file and edit the details to suit your needs. 

Attention I have used firestore to fetch the blogs as I write blogs pretty often. So, if you feel that some data in your portfolio website needs constant updates then feel free to upload those data in firstore or any database of your choice and fetch them to your component.

# Getting Started/Installation
Pretty much the same as the standard gatsby application (or kind of similar to react in someways as gatsby is based on react), so all the usual react-scripts are available to your disposal. So, over here I restricted myself to the instructions to only the essentials.
## 1. Clone the repository or download the zip
```
https://github.com/Sethuram52001/portfolio.git
```

## 2. Install the dependencies
```
npm install
```

## 3. Start the application
```
gatsby develop
```
Runs the app in the development mode.
Open http://localhost:8000 to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.
You will also see any lint errors in the console.
